# PHP/Drupal Coding Challenge

This is a small Drupal coding challenge that we normally ask all candidates to complete in order to help us better assess their coding abilities. The challenge is designed to hopefully not take more than 1-2 hours of your time (assuming you have previous experience with Drupal). The challenge is also designed to be aligned with the PHP/Drupal/DKAN-based project on which you most likely will be working on. The instructions are as follows.

Please develop a _custom_ Drupal module that will render a list of pages that were modified on a _current day_:
* Please develop a _Block_ module
* Ensure your module shows up in the Module Listing
* Include a Drupal test case for your module i.e. Unit Tests.
* Use Drupal 8 preferably.

You may upload your code to your own github/gitlab/bitbucket/etc repository for viewing convenience but please do not create pull requests against this respoitory.

We do understand your time is valuable and therefore tried to keep the scope of this challenge to 1-2 hours. The goal is to see your approach to the problem and your coding style rather than delivering a specific set of features. Note that you will be expected to do a short demo of the code and unit test via screenshare.

Thank you for your interest in SemanticBits!
